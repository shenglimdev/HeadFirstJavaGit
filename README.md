# HeadFirstJava

My name is Sheng, and I have graduated with Computing degree in University of Melbourne. During this pandemic in 2020, I've decided to read through a book called "Head First Java" written by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates to refresh my memory on Java and fill in any gaps of knowledge I might have missed out during my degree course. To further improve my self skill, I have decided that through the course of reading this book, I will be fixing my unconventional typing method to a proper touch typing method.

This is a short introduction. Wish me luck on my journey!
